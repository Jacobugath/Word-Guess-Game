# Word-Guess-Game

This is a fun way guessing game that allows you to guess a comic book action word. I wanted to find a way to make a classic game more challenging. You'll see that it's quite hard to guess the correct word, because they do not conform to normal word formations. The live code is found at https://jacobugath.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/.
