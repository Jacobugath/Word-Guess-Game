# Word-Guess-Game

This is a fun guessing game that allows you to guess a comic book action word. I wanted to find a way to make a classic game more challenging. You'll see that it's quite hard to guess the correct word, because they do not conform to normal word formations. The live code is found at https://jacobugath.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/.

This is one of the first assignments I did through the U of U Full Stack Development Bootcamp. The point of the assignment was to practice dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

The app uses key events to listen for letters that a user will type. The dynamically updated HTML will inform the user whether or not their key stroke is part of the word they are trying to guess. The app also keeps track of the number of wins and losses.
